# Motion And Background System

Use this when planning generated images, text-over-image layouts, GSAP choreography, or visual review.

## Why Videos Look Weak

Most weak motion videos fail for the same reasons:

- Text floats on a flat or generic background.
- The background reads as wallpaper instead of a stage for the idea.
- Motion adds activity but does not guide attention.
- Too many elements compete for hero status.
- Paused hold frames lack a clear message.
- Important text is placed in a safe lower area even when it should dominate the first attention zone.
- Motion is only a slide entrance, so the video feels like a PPT export.

The fix: background creates the world, support assets add semantic depth, typography carries the message, and motion directs the eye.

Before generating a background or animating type over it, choose the layout contract from `references/text-over-background-layout.md`. The contract defines where the subject sits, where text can sit, which image ratio to generate, where mobile safe boundaries live, and where motion is allowed to travel.

## Default Image Rule

For new videos, assume at least one background image stage is needed. Exceptions must be written in the brief:

- Strong supplied product, UI, logo, or footage assets already carry the scene.
- The direction is intentionally pure kinetic typography.
- The task is a narrow edit of an existing composition.

In Phase 1, plan images only. After confirmation, use Codex Image Gen by default for needed bitmap assets and move accepted project-bound files into `assets/images/`.

## Image Count

| Video Type | Image Set |
| --- | --- |
| 6-10s kinetic motion video | 1 background stage, 0-2 support assets |
| 10-15s cinematic short | 1 background stage, 1 symbol or anchor, 1-3 support assets |
| 15-30s launch film | 2-4 scene backgrounds, 1 recurring visual motif, 3-6 support assets reused across beats |
| Product video | Official product/UI assets first; generate atmosphere, metaphor plates, masks, or proof-safe crops only when needed |

If two images do the same job, keep the stronger one.

## Image Roles

Each image gets exactly one primary role:

- Stage: atmosphere, depth, and light.
- Symbol: the central metaphor.
- Texture: grain, haze, material, or light falloff.
- Anchor: product, person, logo, UI, or real object.
- Transition plate: mask, wipe, focus pull, or morph source.

Reject images that only fill space.

## Support Asset Decision

Support assets are not optional decoration. They are the answer to whether the video needs more visual layers than the background stage. The answer can be "none", but it must be deliberate.

Use support assets for:

- Symbol or anchor: the recurring object, product surface, or visual motif the viewer should remember.
- Texture or atmosphere: grain, haze, material, shadow plate, dust, or light falloff that makes the scene tactile.
- Transition plate: matte, aperture, wipe source, mask, focus layer, morph source, or proof-safe cutout.
- Semantic glyph: one minimal meaning-bearing mark, not an icon set.
- Product / UI fragment: a faithful product, interface, chart, or proof crop used when the story needs evidence.
- Motion accent: line, glint, trace, path, bracket, rail, or particle-like detail with a defined attention or transition job.

Generate support bitmap assets only when image generation produces something HyperFrames cannot do better. Prefer CSS/SVG/HyperFrames for lines, masks, marks, glyphs, geometric accents, UI outlines, and anything that must stay sharp, recolorable, or tightly synchronized.

Every support asset must specify:

- Role and source: generated / supplied / code-generated / mixed.
- Local path after generation when bitmap-based.
- Shared style lock: palette, lighting direction, texture language, contrast, and perspective.
- Safe zones: which text or platform regions it must avoid.
- Motion purpose: reveal, depth, transition, proof, attention guide, or hold support.
- Deletion trigger: what makes it noise.

Never use a support asset only because the frame feels empty. First ask whether the copy, crop, scale, light, or timing is weak.

## Text Over Image

- Reserve a quiet text zone before generating or cropping.
- Declare the layout contract, including text rectangle, subject rectangle, image ratio, title tier, mobile safe zones, and motion bounds.
- Declare the first eye target. Hook text and amplified keywords usually own center or upper-center attention when the visual subject does not need that area.
- Keep the focal subject away from title and CTA zones.
- Use local treatment behind text: vignette, shadow plate, gradient mask, blur, or desaturation.
- Put small proof text only on calm image areas.
- If the text needs a card to survive, regenerate, recrop, or simplify the image.
- If the subject is outside its crop-safe zone or text would fall into the bottom platform overlay zone, regenerate or recrop before implementation.

## Motion Rules

Default arc:

```text
World appears -> Title lands -> Metaphor reveals -> Proof locks -> CTA holds
```

Motion budget:

- One primary motion idea per scene.
- One optional support motion for atmosphere or transition.
- Background motion stays slow: push, parallax, focus pull, or light sweep.
- Background motion must preserve the quiet text zone through the full readable hold.
- Text settles before it must be read.
- Text motion must stay inside its declared motion bounds and avoid bottom/right/top mobile UI zones.
- Important reveals need stillness after impact.
- Multi-scene transitions should overlap or share an anchor; avoid empty black gaps.

Prefer mask reveal, clip reveal, rim-light sweep, focus pull, parallax, cross-dissolve, scale settle, or morph-to-logo.

Avoid repeated `y + opacity`, linear primary reveals, infinite loops, decorative particles, random icons, and moving text during reading time.

## CSS3 / SVG / GSAP Motion Craft

Use HTML/CSS/SVG/GSAP as a film language and rendering method.

- CSS3: use `clip-path`, `mask-image`, `filter`, `mix-blend-mode`, perspective transforms, CSS variables, and local darkening when they express reveal, focus, pressure, or transition.
- SVG: use paths, masks, strokes, scan lines, underlines, frames, connectors, and logo lockups when vector structure can guide attention.
- GSAP: build a paused master timeline with labels and explicit positions. Use nested scene timelines only when they remain attached to the master timeline.
- Kinetic typography: define entry, lock, emphasis, exit, and bridge for every important text block.
- Text transitions should transform attention instead of only swapping lines.

If a beat can be described as "text fades up over image," it is under-directed. Rewrite the motion in terms of mask, light, path, camera, crop, split, compression, assembly, or handoff.

## Codex Image Gen Requirements

Every generated-image plan should state:

- Role and aspect ratio.
- Scene/beat where the asset will be used.
- Layout contract and image ratio.
- Focal subject position.
- Quiet text zone.
- Text rectangle and subject rectangle.
- Safe bottom/right/top platform boundaries for overlaid text.
- Required negative space and crop-safe area.
- Lighting direction and contrast.
- Palette and forbidden colors.
- No baked-in text unless required.
- No fake logos, labels, explanatory icons, diagrams, watermark, or decorative clutter.
- For support assets: transparent/cutout intent if needed, isolation margin, consistent lighting, and no unrequested icon set.
- Local output path after acceptance.

After generation, inspect the image before writing animation code:

- Accept only images with a clear role, stable focal subject, usable text-safe space, and a standard ratio.
- Recrop or regenerate when the quiet zone contains busy detail, bright seams, faces, product edges, fake UI, or accidental text.
- Keep final text, proof notes, CTA, masks, parallax, focus pulls, and timing in HyperFrames unless the brief requires baked-in content.
- Remove repeated assets that serve the same role.

## Review Gate

Reject the work if:

- There is no background plan or explicit exception.
- The background could be swapped without changing meaning.
- Support assets are missing when the frame needs semantic depth, transition material, or product proof.
- A support asset has no role, source, motion purpose, safe-zone rule, style lock, or deletion trigger.
- Text readability depends on luck.
- Motion can be removed without changing the story.
- More than one layer tries to be the hero.
- The hero frame is not pause-worthy.
